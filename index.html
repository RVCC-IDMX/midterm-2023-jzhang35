    <h4>My Experience as a Web Developer</h4>

    <br>

    <p>I've had some limited experience in web development as a paid software engineer trainee for about two months 
      with company. We had to design three webpages that were linked together and could send data to and retrieve 
      data from an API. Even though I was a beginner at web design and the project was way beyond my capabilities, I 
      got a lot of help from other trainees to get through the project. I started a webpage development course at 
      RVCC this semester, and it's helped me understand webpage development much better. I enjoy designing webpages 
      for things I'm interested in.</p>
