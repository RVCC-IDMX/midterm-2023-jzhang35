    <h4>My Experience as a Web Developer</h4>

    <br>

    <p>I've had some limited experience in web development as a paid software engineer trainee for two months with 
      company. We had to design three webpages that were linked together and could send data to and retrieve data 
      from an API. Even though I was a beginner at web design and the project was way beyond my capabilities, I got 
      a lot of help from other trainees to get through the project. I started a webpage development course at RVCC 
      this semester, and it's helped me understand webpage development much better.</p>

      "This website's services are very eye opening and opens a gateway to widely unexplored part of the Chinese 
      language on the worldly stage. I'm glad there is work being done in raising awareness for this dialect." 
      - Shanghai Times

      "When people think of Chinese, they either think of Mandarin, the most spoken dialect, or Cantonese, the 
      second most spoken dialect. Shanghainese is actually the third most spoken dialect, yet people hardly think of
      it. From my personal experience in the services provided on this website, I see hope in this dialect 
      becoming more popular and more widely spoken." - Indian residing in Shanghai, Jai Kumar

      "From learning Shanghainese through the services provided on this website, it has opened my eyes to a part of 
      the Chinese language I've never heard. It's a very unconvential dialect that sounds very different from what 
      people tend to think Chinese sounds like. I'm glad I had this experience." - American residing in Shanghai, Chuck Brown
